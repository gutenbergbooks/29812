<h2>NIGHTCAP LETTER No. 2 FROM AUNT FANNY.</h2>


<div class='unindent'><i>You little darling:</i></div>

<p>What <i>do</i> you think happened
the other day? why, a lady
came to see me, bringing with
her just about the dearest little
Kitty that ever lived. Not a
Kitty with whiskers, and four<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
paws, and a fur coat, but a
sweet little girl <i>named</i> Kitty,
with lovely blue eyes, a great
many soft brown curls, and the
same number of sweet rosy lips
that you have. How many is
<i>that,</i> I should like to know? I
had never seen the lady, or the
little girl before, and of course
I did not know their names until
afterwards. So I bowed, and
smiled, and looked as pleasant
as ever I could.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Kitty said in a sweet
trembling voice&mdash;"<i>Is</i> you Aunt
Fanny?"</p>

<p>I laughed a little bit, and
answered, "Yes, dear."</p>

<p>What happened then? Why
in a moment she ran up to me,
climbed upon a chair close by,&mdash;threw
her arms around my
neck, and gave me such a precious
little smothering hug, and
so many sweet kisses, with her
soft face pressed with all her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
might upon my cheek, that I
almost lost my breath, and was
perfectly astonished, as well as
delighted.</p>

<p>Then the little girl said: "Oh
thank you, dear Aunt Fanny,
<i>twenty-ten</i> times, for my Baby
Nightcaps! I love them! I
love you! I love you <i>dreadfully!</i>"
Oh! how glad I was to hear
that! I was glad "<i>twenty-ten</i>"
times. It was sweeter to me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
than a whole basket full of
sugar candies would be to you&mdash;and
I kissed her on both her
round dimpled cheeks, and sat
down, and took her on my lap,
and hugged her to my heart,
and said&mdash;"what a darling!
what a dear little thing!"</p>

<p>Then I looked at the lady.
She was laughing and blushing,
and I was laughing and blushing,
and the little girl was
laughing and blushing. Don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
you think we three were having
a very funny kind of time?
<i>I</i> did.</p>

<p>At last the lady said: "I
hope you will excuse me for
bringing Kitty to see you; but
she begged so hard for 'just
one little look at Aunt Fanny,'
I could not bear to refuse her.
I am afraid she has taken a
great deal more than 'one little
look.' I hope she has not kissed
a piece out of your cheek?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>At this, Kitty looked up in
great alarm at my cheek&mdash;but
seeing that it was not bleeding,
and had no hole in it, she patted
it softly with her little tender
dimpled hand, and said: "<small>Aunt Fanny,
Aunt Fanny,</small>" in a little speck of a
whisper to herself a great many
times.</p>

<p>Then I said: "I am <i>so</i> glad
to know that you were pleased
with Baby Nightcaps. Would
you like me to ask poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lame Charley's mother for
more?"</p>

<p>With a joyful little scream,
she hugged me again, and kissed
my cheek&mdash;<i>very softly</i> this time,
for fear of hurting me, and said:
"Oh! Aunt Fanny! if you only
will, I will give you a whole
paper full of <i>perl</i>asses candy,
and one of my new <i>handkerchickers;</i>
and when you are old
and blind, I will take you in my
arms, and carry you up stairs,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and put you in my lap <i>and
teach you your letters</i>, and ask
mamma to read the Bible to
you&mdash;all about Joseph, you
know, and his wicked <i>bredders;</i>
it will make you <i>ki</i>."</p>

<p>Wasn't she a cunning little
thing? I could not help laughing,
to think of such a little
mite of a child, talking of taking
me in her arms; and then I
could not help the tears coming,
at her offer to have her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mamma read the Bible to me&mdash;was
it not sweet? <i>You</i> would
have done so too, wouldn't you?
You see, it must have been
Kitty's greatest pleasure, to
have God's Holy Bible read to
her; so she promised me, what
she thought was the very best
thing in the whole world. And
so it is.</p>

<p>You may be sure, that I told
her, I would try to get the
stories very soon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Pretty soon Kitty and her
mamma went away; but not
before we had given each other
one more real good kiss, and I
had prayed in my heart that
God would bless the precious
little child, and guide me with
my new book, so that it would
help Kitty and you to be good,
obedient children, His precious
little lambs here upon
earth, and His bright, beautiful
angels in Heaven.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening I put on my
bonnet and shawl, and went to
see lame Charley's mother. As
I rang the bell, I heard such a
quantity of laughing voices, and
so many little feet pattering, I
was almost certain, that at least
twenty cousins must have come
to town to help them have a
good time: but when the door
was opened, I saw they were
all Nightcap Children, rushing
down stairs together. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
had gone up to wash their faces
and hands and brush their hair,
and were coming down all
laughing and talking at once,
so you may be sure it made a
great noise.</p>

<p>Bless their little chattering
tongues, and pattering feet!
You can't expect children to
be as grave and solemn as
judges&mdash;of course not. I, for
one, would not give a pin for
a child that did not make<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a noise&mdash;that is&mdash;a pleasant
noise.</p>

<p>So they were jumping and
tumbling down, when I entered,
and in a moment they
were all about me crying.
"How-de-do, Aunt Fanny?
Come in, come in, mamma is
in the parlor, and Charley is
sitting in her lap&mdash;and the
<span class="smcap">tremendous</span> DOG is asleep on
the rug&mdash;and we are not to
have a Nightcap story to-night&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
something grand!
splendid!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i002.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="THE TREMENDOUS DOG!" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE TREMENDOUS DOG!</span>
</div>

<p>"Somesing 'tonishing," chimed
in little Minnie&mdash;"<i>tome!</i>
<i>kick!</i>"&mdash;by which she meant
me to "come quick"&mdash;and not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to tell me to kick anybody&mdash;oh
dear, no!</p>

<p>So we all hurried along&mdash;and
how I got into the room, without
stepping upon some of their
dear little toes, I am sure I
don't know, but nobody seemed
to be hurt&mdash;and heads and toes
came in all safe&mdash;and Charley
lifted up his sweet pale face for
a kiss, and his mother shook
hands with me, and then we all
sat down, and the boys said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
"hush," and the girls said
"hush," till it sounded so much
like a room brimful of cats
sneezing, that I laughed; and
that made the children laugh,
and then of course they had to
jump up and down in their
seats, and the girls had to twirl
round and make cheeses, and
this made the <span class="smcap">tremendous</span> DOG
laugh, which he did by wagging
his tail, like a flag in a high
wind, and giving two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
short barks, and it was just as
good as going to Barnum's
Museum, to see such a "happy
family." If you had asked
<i>Barnum</i> about it, he would
have said it was ever so much
better.</p>

<p>At last I said: "Dear little
Charley, I have put the stories
told to you, and Minnie, and
the rest, into three Nightcap
books. They have pleased the
children very much. I know<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
this, because I have received
a great many letters; such nice
letters! telling me how the
children laughed and cried, and
not one single word in any of
them to say that anybody put
his mouth out of joint, yawning
over the stories. Instead of
that, they all want more; and
this very day a sweet little girl
came to see me to ask for
more. She was not like poor
Oliver Twist, asking for food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
for her body. Oh no! she was
a plump, merry, rosy-cheeked
darling, just like Minnie, and
eat just as much good bread
and milk as she wanted, and
molasses candy, too&mdash;for she
promised to give me ever so
much, if I would only give her
another Nightcap book&mdash;and
what is more and better, she
has promised to read the Bible
to me, when I am old and
blind."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you ever!" shouted
the children; "Aunt Fanny, old
and blind! We'll read to you,
too, the whole Bible, and all
the books in the bookcase beside!
When are you going to
be? Will you walk with a
long black cane like old Granny
Van Winkle? Do begin pretty
soon, because we want to be
kind to you, and read to you,
too!"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;no!" said the sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
voice of lame Charley. "Dear
Aunt Fanny, we <i>don't</i> want you
to be old and blind; you shall
have all mamma's pretty stories
without it. I am glad the children
like them. <i>I</i> think them
lovely; my back does not hurt
me near so much while she is
telling them, and when I die,
which I think will be very soon
now, I hope the children will
think of me sometimes, and
love my darling mamma, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
has given them and me so
many pleasant hours. This is
my birthday, Aunt Fanny. I
am ten years old to-day. Perhaps
it is my last birthday.
See what my brothers and sisters
have given to me."</p>

<p>In the midst of a sad silence,
(for the children were now quite
still, and were looking at Charley,
with their eyes full of love
and tears,) I went up to a
table, at which he had pointed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and saw what looked like a
large tin box. It proved to be
a splendid magic lantern! The
children had saved all their
money for many months to be
able to buy it, and the little
mother told me, that when
they came in a body that morning
and gave it to Charley, with
their dear love and many kisses,
their faces glowing with pleasure,
it was the sweetest sight
in the world to see, and Charley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
thought he could never
thank or love them enough,
and that very morning he made
this little prayer, and added it
to his others:</p>

<p>"Oh God, I am a poor little
suffering child. Very often, I
cannot help crying with pain.
But many children suffer as
much as I do, and have not one
of my blessings; and Jesus, my
Saviour, suffered far more. He
was innocent and good, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
we, for whom He suffered,
are sometimes very naughty.
Please, God, to forgive me for
being naughty, and bless and
love my dear brothers and sisters
who are so kind to me, and
please bless my darling mother,
and if I die before another year,
may we all meet again in heaven,
I pray, for Jesus' sake.
Amen."</p>

<p>The tears came into my eyes
as I listened to this little prayer&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
I bent my face down and
kissed Charley's white forehead
to hide them&mdash;and whispered
to him that I would tell it to
the children outside in the
world, and perhaps this little
prayer might be learned by
some other sick child&mdash;and it
would comfort them, and I
would also give them the new
stories&mdash;at which he smiled and
said: "Oh, yes, do!" and all
the rest said: "Do, Aunt Fanny;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and stay to-night&mdash;and see the
magic lantern&mdash;then you can
tell them about that, too, you
know; they'll be so glad, they
won't know what to do."</p>

<p>So I staid; and pretty soon
there was a great scampering,
and bustling, and climbing up
on chairs, to fasten a large
sheet over the opening of one
of the doors, and then the
grandest of the company&mdash;which
consisted of Charley, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">tremendous</span> DOG, and myself&mdash;were
put, with a great many polite
speeches, into the best places
in front; and the rest shook,
and jumped, and tumbled themselves
into seats behind us&mdash;and
all the lights were put out,
and everybody was in a perfect
state of delightful expectation,
as they shouted: "Here we
are, mamma, with all our eyes
staring at the sheet ready for
the show."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the little mother went
into the next room with the
magic lantern, and lighted a
lamp inside, and placed it close
to the sheet. In a moment, a
large, bright circle of light appeared
on the sheet&mdash;and in a
moment more, we saw a splendid
picture of Daniel in the
Lions' Den; the lions with their
fierce-looking mouths wide
open, and their sharp claws
spread out as if they would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
snap up Daniel the very next
instant&mdash;upon which the children
raised such a shout that I
thought my head was coming
off&mdash;and it was quite fortunate
that the picture was changed to
one of Moses in the Bulrushes,
which delighted the children
beyond every thing; but when
there came a picture of little
Samuel praying&mdash;a low murmur
of&mdash;"Oh! how lovely! what a
good little Samuel! how I love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
him!" sounded softly through
the room.</p>

<p>There was one picture of a
cross old school ma'am, with a
great hook nose, and a long
whip, looking so savage at
three poor little children that
did not seem to know their lessons&mdash;that
Minnie cried out:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" width="550" height="353" alt="THE PICTURE IN THE MAGIC LANTERN." title="" />
<span class="caption">THE PICTURE IN THE MAGIC LANTERN.</span>
</div>

<p>"Oh! see the poor chillens!
they don't know their A, B, C.
Ah! I so sorry for them!"
and then all the children said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
"Poor things! why don't they
run away&mdash;I would! Because
she looks so cross! let's scratch
a smile on her face with a pin,
and <i>make</i> her look pleasant."</p>

<p>But the best picture of all
was Noah's Ark. First the ark
came on alone&mdash;then a plank
seemed to be put down&mdash;then
came the great elephants,
lions, tigers, and bears, marching
up the plank two and
two into the ark&mdash;and after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
them all the rest of the animals
in the world, getting smaller
and smaller, until little wee
monkeys, and kittens, and mice,
and robins, and grasshoppers,
and blind beetles, and big spiders,
and tumble-bugs, ran and
hopped, and skipped, and crawled
up the plank in such quantities,
that it was quite a wonder
they were not all suffocated in
such a crowd. But didn't the
children clap their hands and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
cry: "Look! look!" when Noah
and his wife, and his three
sons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet,
and their families, marched
gravely past, looking straight
before them, and went into the
ark, and the ark sailed slowly
off! It was perfect! they wished
they could have gone into
the ark, too, to put apples into
the elephant's trunk, and play
with the monkeys, and count all
the animals&mdash;George guessed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
there must have been at
least a thousand&mdash;while Annie
thought a million went in.
How many do you think, you
dear little darling?</p>

<p>The magic lantern was a
great success, and Minnie said:
"the magic <i>nightcat</i> was the
bestest of all."</p>

<p>After the show was over, I
kissed everybody, and went
home quite happy in the promise
of my new stories&mdash;and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
may be sure, you dear little
poppet, that Kitty, and you,
and all the darling children
shall have them as fast as the
printer can print them. If
you like them, just go to Mr.
Appleton's, and coax him to
tell you where I live; and then
run up to my house on your
dear little feet, and give one
real good kiss to your loving
Aunt Fanny.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> evening the little nightcap
mother said: "Children, I
have had a most charming present.
It is a copy of some letters
and stories that were written
and told to your little friend,
Bella Curtis. They are a kind
of baby stories, for children like
Minnie. Do you think you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
shall like them? Do <i>you</i> Charley?"</p>

<p>Then the children all shouted
out "Certainly! Of course! the
baby stories are the best! no,
not the best, but just as good
as the <i>old</i> stories&mdash;yes, mamma,
do read them. Letters! why
that is something new&mdash;how
very nice."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to hear
A&mdash;B&mdash;C," cried little Minnie,
who was just learning her letters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and thought it very hard
work&mdash;"I don't like letters a
bit."</p>

<p>How the children did laugh
when they saw Minnie's long
face, and heard her queer
speech; but they soon explained
to her, that these letters were a
new sort of delightful story&mdash;upon
which she folded her little
fat hands and sat down quite
comforted, that these letters had
nothing to do with her A, B, C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>And Charley said: "I love
that dear little Bella, mamma,
and I shall be so pleased to
hear her letters. I thank her
very much for sending them to
you."</p>

<p>Then the children seated
themselves, and puckered up
their mouths&mdash;so as to keep all
the little laughs in. They
couldn't keep their eyes from
sparkling; but as that could be
done without making a noise&mdash;it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
was rather a help, as it
showed how delighted they expected
to be&mdash;and gave the little
mother such a happy look,
that they came very near all
rushing upon her to kiss her;
but they managed to keep still,
and the new nightcap letters
began as follows:&mdash;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE NIGHTCAP LETTERS,</h2>

<h3>HOW THEY CAME TO BE WRITTEN.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Bella's</span> mother was quite ill;
and the doctor said she must go
for awhile to the sweet, sunny
South&mdash;far away from the cold
March winds.</p>

<p>Poor little Bella did not want
her mother to go. When she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
heard of it, she began to cry,
and climbed up into her mother's
lap, and kissing her cheek said:
"Stay with Bella, mamma, do
please; Bella will take care of
you, and make you well."</p>

<p>"But the doctor says I must
go, my darling," answered her
mother. "If you cry, it will
make me worse, because I shall
feel so miserable to see you
crying; but you mean to be
good, don't you? and when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
get to Charleston, I will write
you ever so many little letters
one after the other, and you
must tell papa what to say,
and he will write the answers.
Won't that be nice? The postman
will bring you your letters,
and then you must pay him two
cents apiece for every one of
them, think of that! Dear me!
how much money it will take!
do you think you will have
money enough?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"My <i>pasense</i>," exclaimed
Bella; "what a heap of letters!
Oh, how glad I am! I'll buy
every one, mamma! I'll go and
count my money now!"</p>

<p>So she ran to her drawer, and
took out a little velvet purse.
It looked very fat and heavy.
Then she sat down on the carpet
and opened it, and out
tumbled ever so many bright
pennies into her lap&mdash;quite
enough to astonish the postman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and make him wish he could
sell her six letters at once.
Bella clapped her hands and
laughed, and thumped her heels
merrily up and down, and made
the pennies jingle in her lap so
pleasantly, that it seemed as if
they were singing a little song.</p>

<p>The thought of the letters
was such a comfort to Bella,
that she saw her mother's
trunks packed without crying a
bit, though a poor little sigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
would come out once in a
while; but she told Edith, her
elder sister, that she meant to
behave in the "<i>goodest manner</i>,"
and almost to seem glad that
her dear mamma was going
away, because that would help
to make her well.</p>

<p>It would have delighted you
to see little Bella "helping."
She ran all round the room, to
find something to put in the
trunks. She tucked a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
cake of soap into one corner,
and half a dozen hair pins in
another; and then hunting in
her funny little pocket, she
found two gum drops, which
her Cousin George had given to
her&mdash;these she did up in a scrap
of paper, and very carefully
stowed away under the fold of
a pair of stockings.</p>

<p>Well, at last the time came
to say "good-bye," and poor
little Bella clung to her mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and the great sobs <i>would</i> come,
and no one could blame her, for
her mamma was crying too&mdash;and
her little Bella's face was
covered with tears as well as
kisses. But this dear mamma
had to go&mdash;and the steamship
went swiftly away with her,
and in a little while she could
no longer see the great city of
New York, where her darling
lived.</p>

<p>Bella cried a long time, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
did not want to go back into
her mamma's room. At last
she thought she would go. On
the bed was a large paper
parcel. Something was written
on the paper, and she called her
sister to "read the reading" to
her.</p>

<p>"Why! what's this?" exclaimed
Edith. "'For my little
Bella.' How very strange."</p>

<p>"Dear me," cried Bella, giving
a jump; "it must be for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
me&mdash;'spose I look? I want to
look so much."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Edith. Then
the paper was taken off by the
little girl's dimpled fingers, and
there was displayed a most
beautiful bedstead, with a lovely
baby tucked up in it, fast
asleep!</p>

<p>I only wish you could have
seen the dimples on Bella's face
then! and the sparkles in her
eyes! She softly lifted the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
baby up&mdash;and pop! her blue
eyes opened as wide as possible&mdash;and
she never cried a bit,
but just looked at Bella, not
the least afraid of being among
strangers.</p>

<p>Then Bella laid her gently
down, and the good little thing
shut her eyes and went fast
asleep again.</p>

<p>"My pasense!" said Bella,
"I'm <i>apprised!</i> What a dear
baby! Is it for me?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"It must be," said Edith;
"but wait, here is a little letter
pinned fast to her sleeve. Let's
see what it says."</p>

<p>"A letter," cried Bella;
"must I pay two cents for
it?" and she ran to get her
little velvet purse.</p>

<p>"You will not have to pay
for this one, because the baby
brought it&mdash;it is only the postman
that wants two cents."</p>

<p>So Edith opened the letter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and Bella jumped up and down
all the time her sister was
reading these loving words:&mdash;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<h2>FIRST LETTER.</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Dear Darling Bella</span>:</div>

<p>"Here is a present for you
of this little bedstead, and the
pretty doll baby; who will go
to sleep the moment you put
her in bed. Don't cry any
more, my little kitten, and rosebud,
and pearl, and dove. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
will pray to our Heavenly
Father to take care of us both,
and before long you will be
clasped tight in the arms of
your loving <i>mother</i>."</p>

<p>The little girl's lip trembled,
as Edith finished the letter;
but she lifted up the baby
just then&mdash;and the blue eyes
opened so suddenly, that it set
Bella laughing&mdash;and she said
lovingly: "<i>Pessus keeter</i>, come
to mamma," and so the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
mamma that couldn't say
"precious creature" plain, forgot
to cry.</p>

<p>"Why! only see here!" exclaimed
Edith, "here is another
bundle under the bedstead!
It must have come from the
moon;" and drawing it out,
she handed it to Bella.</p>

<p>"Oh! how 'lightful," cried
Bella. "Two bundles! I shall
jump out of the window for
joy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the paper was
eagerly taken off, and lo! and
behold! there was a most
beautiful pair of little brown
gaiter boots.</p>

<p>"With heels!" screamed
Bella. "How grandy! like a
big lady! look, Edith&mdash;heels!"</p>

<p>"Did I ever!" said Edith,
lifting up her hands, "you will
tumble down stairs the very
first time you wear them."</p>

<p>"Boots with heels!" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Bella began to try them on.
Something stiff rattled inside&mdash;and
she put in her hand and
pulled out&mdash;another letter! It
was almost too good to be true.</p>

<p>But Edith soon read these
kind words:</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECOND LETTER.</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<i>My little Darling:</i></div>

<p>"Here are a pair of boots
for your dear little feet, with
the heels on them, that you
wanted so much.</p>

<p>"Be careful to go down stairs
<i>very slowly</i>, for fear you might
catch your heels on the edge,
and fall and hurt yourself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"Don't let your little heel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Bump your little head;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That would hurt a deal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And make it very red.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Then so bad 'twould feel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Like a lump of lead.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">First with careful zeal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Very gently tread;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Do not jump or squeal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Precious little maid.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But, when at your meal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Eating milk and bread,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Sing a merry peal,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Without any dread.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Dance a little reel,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Then skip up to bed."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, how nice," cried Bella,
when Edith had finished. "I
like that. It is so jingly and
jangly."</p>

<p>"Why! how you talk!"
said Edith, laughing. "It's
poetry."</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Bella. "O&mdash;h!"</p>

<p>She put both her precious
letters in her drawer, and then
played with her baby all the
rest of the day. I believe the
good little thing went to sleep,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and woke up again that day
about fifty-nine times&mdash;maybe
sixty.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE FIRST LETTER FROM CHARLESTON.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">About</span> a week after this,
there came such a tremendous
ring at the bell, that both the
fat cook and the waiter rushed
to the door, and when it was
opened, there stood the postman!
bawling out, "A letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for Miss Bella Curtis! Two
cents!"</p>

<p>How Miss Bella Curtis did
scamper for her two cents to
pay the postman! and how delighted
she looked when he
gave her the letter! The postman
thought there must at
least be a gold watch inside
of it, she seemed so pleased.</p>

<p>Bella tore the envelope all to
pieces in her hurry to open her
letter; and then she fell over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
sideways from the little bench
in her hurry to sit down&mdash;but
at last she was settled as still
as you could expect under such
delightful circumstances&mdash;and
Edith read this.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>
<h2>THIRD LETTER.</h2>


<div class='right'>
<small>"<span class="smcap">Charleston</span>, <i>March.</i></small><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Dear Darling Bella</span>:</div>

<p>"Here I am all safe, sitting
in a pleasant room, with the
window opened&mdash;listening to
the singing of the pretty birds,
and looking at three little black
picaninnies over the way, playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with a small white dog.
They throw a little stick as far
as ever they can, and then the
little dog rushes after it, in such
a hurry, that you would think
he was going to leave his tail
behind him; but he don't, because
it is fastened on so very
tight. The next minute he
trots back with the stick in his
mouth, and hands it with his
<i>mouth</i>, you know, very politely
to the children, while they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
jump up and down, and
squeal, because they are so
pleased.</p>

<p>"Now they have all scrambled
heels over head into the yard,
and shut the dog's tail in the
gate; but he pulled it through,
and so I can't see them any
more.</p>

<p>"I hope the doll baby has
been good, and the little heels
on the boots have behaved
themselves. Good-bye, my darling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Pray to God every night
and morning for your loving</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>Bella smiled, and patted one
little hand with the other, and
a sweet loving expression came
into her eyes as the last words
of the letter was read to her,
and she said: "Darling mamma.
I love her. I want to go to
Heaven with her."</p>

<p>The dear little child had been
told that there would be no pain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
or crying in Heaven, and so she
knew it must be a very happy
place.</p>

<p>When her papa came home,
Bella ran up to him with her
letter, exclaiming: "Oh papa,
see! see the letter mamma
<i>writed</i> to me!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible! Why, what
a big woman you are getting
to be!" and he took her upon
his knee, and read the letter&mdash;out
loud of course, for Bella<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
could have heard it fifty times
with delight.</p>

<p>"Ah! that is a beautiful
letter," said her papa; "you
must answer it, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, papa; and I want
to, 'ight away now."</p>

<p>"Oh! do you? Well, here
is a sheet of paper, and pen and
ink. Put out your tongue;
dear me, how long it is! it
looks in very good talking
order. Now you talk, and I'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
write, and see if we won't have
a letter, for which mamma will
give two cents, and all her old
shoes, to the postman. Come!
<i>you</i> must begin first."</p>

<p>Then Bella put her little
curly head one side, and stared
up at a corner of the ceiling.
She was thinking, you see.
Presently she put her finger in
her mouth, as if to pull the
words out&mdash;then she looked at
her father. Her father smiled,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
which made her take her finger
out of her mouth, and shut her
eyes&mdash;for she felt funny&mdash;and a
little bashful. You see this was
a very grave business&mdash;writing
a letter that her mamma would
have to pay two cents for&mdash;very
serious business indeed.</p>

<p>All at once her eyes rested
on her dolly, fast asleep in her
pretty bed; and then the words
came right out&mdash;"Oh, dear
mamma! I love my little baby,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
and the heels, and the bedstead,
and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, papa! I love
mamma the mostest. I gave
my baby a piece of apple pie
for her dinner. It was made
of paper, just for fun, you know;
not really apple pie. She hates
pepper, it makes her tongue
bite&mdash;mine too. She wants
you to come home s&mdash;o bad&mdash;the
bedstead wants you to come
home, and I want the postman
to bring me a letter, and you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
too&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I don't know
any more this day."</p>

<p>"That is a beautiful letter,"
said her father; "now sign your
name just here&mdash;and I will seal
it up, and direct it on the outside,
and send it to the post
office."</p>

<p>So Bella made such a funny
little scratch with the pen for
her name, that it looked as if a
fly had turned round and round,
with ink on its legs, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then the letter went off on its
travels.</p>

<p>The next day her cousin
Stanny came to spend the day
with Bella. Stanny was a dear
little fellow, with light hair, and
great blue eyes, and cheeks as
fat as butter&mdash;they were so fat
that the dimples had hard work
to make holes in them.</p>

<p>Bella loved Stanny, and she
ran to kiss him, and show him
her new baby, and the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
things; and what do you think
Stanny did when he saw the
baby in the bed? Why, he tilted
up the bedstead, and out fell
dolly flat on her nose! That
was just like a boy&mdash;they will
never do to be mothers, like
little girls&mdash;because they play
so roughly.</p>

<p>"Oh Stanny," cried Bella,
picking up the dolly tenderly,
"she's most killded."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't she cry then?"
said Stanny.</p>

<p>"'Cause she isn't a cry baby,"
said Bella.</p>

<p>"I mean to punch her and
make her cry," said Stanny.</p>

<p>So he doubled up his fist and
gave the dolly a great punch
in the stomach&mdash;but the dear
little thing just stared at him
without winking, and never said
a word. You see the truth
was that she had no crying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
place made inside of her, as
some of the babies have&mdash;and I
for one think it was quite an
improvement, for who wants to
hear a baby squealing like a pig&mdash;you
don't, do you? you little
kitten!</p>

<p>Bella did not like to have
her baby treated in this manner&mdash;and
it was very fortunate
that their grandmamma came
in the room just then, with two
large slices of bread, with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
most delightful currant jelly
spread all over them, and gave
one to each of the children, or
perhaps Bella might have turned
into a cry-baby&mdash;and that
would have made you and me
very sorry.</p>

<p>Pretty soon a lady came in&mdash;whom
the children called
Cousin Caroline, and said: "Oh!
here is Stanny; why, where did
you come from, little boy?"</p>

<p>"I come from Brooklyn.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
What you got your hat on for,
Cousin Caroline? Say."</p>

<p>"Because I am going to see
old Mrs. Badger, up the street."</p>

<p>"Are you? Which do you
like best, Mrs. Badger, up the
street, or grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"Why, Stanny! I like grandmamma
a great deal the best."</p>

<p>"But, why for?" said Stanny.</p>

<p>"Why, because she is my
aunt," said Cousin Caroline.</p>

<p>"Your aunt!" cried Stanny,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in a tone of severe reproof.
"Oh, Cousin Caroline, aren't you
ashamed to call my grandma
an <i>ant!</i> a little ugly black
thing, crawling on the ground.
She isn't an ant, now! she's a
big grandma."</p>

<p>You may be sure that Cousin
Caroline and grandma laughed
at this long speech&mdash;and then
Stanny and Bella laughed&mdash;and
they all thought it was a very
funny idea&mdash;to make a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
black ant out of a big grandma.</p>

<p>The rest of the day Bella
played she was the mother and
Stanny the grandfather; and
except he wanted to whip poor
dolly very often, because he
said she was naughty, they got
along pretty well; and upon
the whole they both had a very
pleasant day.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>
<h2>FOURTH LETTER.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A letter</span> for Miss Bella
Curtis," said the postman; "two
cents."</p>

<p>Oh, what delightful words
those were. Bella began quite
to love the postman; and she
asked him if he wouldn't please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to take <i>three</i> cents&mdash;which astonished
him so much, that I
do believe nobody had ever
thought of saying so to him
before.</p>

<p>The little girl pulled off the
envelope with trembling eagerness,
and Edith read this:</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />"<span class="smcap">Dear, Darling Bella</span>:</div>

<p>"I was so delighted with
your letter that I kissed every
word once, and the dear little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
scratch, that meant your name,
about a dozen times. Yesterday
was Sunday, and I went
to church. Just in front of me
sat a dear little girl so like you,
that I wanted to lift her over
the back of the pew and kiss
her. She was such a little
thing, that she did not know
how to sit still. She had on a
pair of worsted sleeves, and the
very first thing she did, was to
poke all the fingers of one little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
hand through the ruffle round
the other, just as you do with
your sleeves. Then she smiled
at me, and I smiled at her;
then she spread out her little
pocket handkerchief, and found
a small hole in the corner, about
as big as a three-cent piece.
She stuck her finger through
that, and held it up, and danced
it up and down; then she dusted
the pew with it, which made
it rather dirty. She was such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
little bit of a thing that you
could hardly expect her to sit
quite still; but this that I am
going to tell you now, was really
naughty.</p>

<p>"There was a boy in the pew
just in front. She gave him
three pretty hard taps on the
back of his head, and when he
looked round, she pretended to
be asleep. What a girl!</p>

<p>"When we came out I shook
hands with her, and said: 'I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
have a little girl at home in the
North, her name is Bella; what
is your name?'</p>

<p>"'My name is Bella, too,' she
said. Wasn't that wonderful?</p>

<p>"As I walked home, I saw
such a sweet little white girl,
carried in the arms of a great
black woman, whose head looked
like an immense butterfly,
fastened on her shoulders; for
she had a handkerchief on it,
of all the colors of the rainbow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
and it was spread out on either
side like wings.</p>

<p>"The sweet little child seemed
to love her black nurse dearly,
for as I walked behind, I
saw her press her tender, lovely,
pink and white cheek, close
against the dusky face of her
nurse, and I heard her say in a
sweet lisping tone: 'Oh, Binah,
I love you. When I go to Heaven,
I will take you with me.
Oh, B-i-n-a-h!' she said this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
last word just like the cooing
of a little dove.</p>

<p>"'Bress de darlin' chile,' said
Binah. 'I am gwine back <i>now</i>,
little missis. Ole Binah hab to
go to Heben fust, and wait dere
for little darlin' missis.'</p>

<p>"You see Binah meant by
'gwine back now,' that she was
old. When people are old, they
say, they are going 'down hill,'
but Binah said, 'going back.'
You are climbing <i>up</i> the hill of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
life, my dear little Bella; and I
pray that God will lead you in
the right path, and then the hill
both up and down will end in a
happy home in Heaven.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what a long letter.
Give my best love to papa
and sister; and kiss yourself on
your dear little cheek if you
can, for your loving</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Mother</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>Here is Bella's answer:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>


<div class='unindent'><br />"<span class="smcap">Darling Mamma</span>,</div>

<p>"I was so glad to get your
letter! What a naughty little
girl that was in the church!
She behaved twice as bad as
me. I speak out loud sometimes,
not very often; only
sometimes. I had a party yesterday&mdash;Minnie,
and Lilly, and
Jeannie; and we had tea out of
my cups and saucers that Cousin
Caroline gave me&mdash;real tea&mdash;and
one orange that papa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
brought home&mdash;it was all pulled
to pieces, and we eat it all
up.</p>

<p>"We played with my paper
dolls; and one of them, Miss
Hattie Smith, knocked down a
little table and <i>broke</i> one of my
glass candle <i>stickers</i>, that Cousin
Caroline gave me.</p>

<p>"Really, and truly, I <span class="smcap">found</span>
it broke; but we made believe
that she broke it because she is
so ugly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dolly has been very naughty.
She fighted with sister's
Kitty, and Kitty tore all the
lace off her cap. Kitty slapped
her first. Then sister Edith
told dolly and Kitty about
'dogs delight to bark and bite,'
and dolly was so sorry, and
Kitty too; and they never mean
to do so any more&mdash;never&mdash;sister
Edith mended the cap,
and she is good now&mdash;next
time papa brings me candy, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
will give her a big piece&mdash;only
pretend, you know&mdash;for her
mouth can't open like mine, it
is all shut up tight&mdash;what a
pity! Oh mamma! I want to
see you so much, I don't know
what to do. Why can't the
postman bring you home? Oh
mamma, I can't wait any longer."</p>

<p>Here poor little Bella began
to cry; and her papa thought
her letter was long enough, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that the little thing was tired,
as well as grieved. So he folded
up the letter, and took Bella
upon his knee, and kissed her,
and wiped away her tears, and
said: "My darling little pet,
would you like to hear a story
that I know?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, papa," said Bella,
lifting her head from his breast,
and smiling: though a great
tear still trembled on her long
lashes, "I love a story."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I love you," said her
papa; "so here it is."</p>


<div class='center'><br />PAPA'S STORY.<br />

<small>THE DINNER PARTY.</small></div>

<p>"Once upon a time, there
lived a little girl, named Edith.
She was a dear good little puss,
and that was the reason everybody
loved her. Don't you
think it was a very good reason?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, papa," said Bella; and
she squeezed her soft cheek
lovingly against him, and he
gave her a little hug; and then
they went on again quite comfortable
with the story.</p>

<p>"Well, one day her papa said
to her mamma, 'My dear, I
shall not be home to-day to
dinner; but what shall I order
for yours?'</p>

<p>"'Well, dear,' she answered,
'I think one beef-steak, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
some green peas, and potatoes,
will do for Edith and me; and
the cook shall make a poor
man's pudding, with raisins in
it; that will be a very nice little
dinner.'</p>

<p>"'If I see any thing very
nice, I will send that too.'</p>

<p>"'Very well.' Then Edith's
papa kissed all the family. It
did not take him very long,
for he had only Edith and
her mamma for a family at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
that time; and then he went
away.</p>

<p>"Pretty soon after, Edith
said: 'Mamma, will you please
to let me go next door,
and play with Annie, and
Mary?'</p>

<p>"'Yes, dear,' answered her
mother; 'but do not forget to
come home at five o'clock to
dinner.'</p>

<p>"Edith promised to come, and
then skipped joyfully off&mdash;with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
her best doll, Miss Polly Dolly
Adeline, and two big apples to
play 'party' with, and in a
few minutes her mother thought
there must be at least twenty
children next door, instead of
three; for they were having
such a good time that they
made noise enough to frighten
the crows into fits, if any crows
happened that way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i005.jpg" width="550" height="344" alt="WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT THE FAT COOK, WITH A GREAT GOOSE." title="" />
<span class="caption">WHO SHOULD COME IN BUT THE FAT COOK, WITH A GREAT GOOSE.</span>
</div>

<p>"As her mother was sitting
at her sewing, some one knocked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
at the door, and who should
come in, but the fat cook, with
a great goose, fatter than she
was; who cried out: 'Only
see what a big goost, mum;
and only you and Miss Edith
to eat it; besides a beef-steak
to brile, and peas and potatoes.'</p>

<p>"'Dear me,' said her mistress,
'we could not eat a quarter of
that goose. Save it for to-morrow,
Mrs. Jellybag. Only cook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the beef-steak and vegetables;
and make a poor man's pudding,
with raisins, for dessert; that will
do nicely.' So the fat cook put
the fat goose carefully away in
the refrigerator; then she shelled
enough peas for a small dish,
and peeled about a dozen potatoes,
and prepared the raisins
for the pudding, and had them
all nicely done in time.</p>

<p>"When five o'clock came, the
bell rang for dinner, and Edith's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mother went down, and took
her seat at the table.</p>

<p>"Just then she heard a whole
chorus of merry little voices,
and to her great surprise, in
marched Edith, and seven little
girls after her! They were
all nearly of the same size, with
their hair braided in two tails
apiece, as fine as you please.</p>

<p>"'Why, Edith!!' exclaimed
her mother.</p>

<p>"'Yes, mamma,' said Edith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
'I told them to come in and
get some dinner, and some nice
poor man's pudding, with raisins
in it; they are Annie's and
Mary's cousins. They are real
nice, and we are having such
fun!'</p>

<p>"You see Edith had no idea
that her mother would not like
her bringing the little girls in
to dine with her; she did not
<i>mean</i> to do wrong; and her
eyes glittered so brightly with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
pleasure at having so many
friends, that her mamma burst
out laughing; and then Edith
and all the children giggled in
such a funny way, that I do believe
if the Mayor of New York
could have seen their happy
faces, he would have given his
best wig, to have such pleasant
people at <i>his</i> dinner parties.</p>

<p>"And now the children began
to stare at the beef-steak with
hungry eyes; and Edith's mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
thought it grew smaller and
smaller, and was afraid if she
gave each one a piece, they
would swallow the whole of it
at once like a pill. Dear me!
how she did wish the goose had
been cooked; but there was no
help for it now: so seven extra
plates were set, like buttons
round the table, and seven extra
knives and forks were laid
across like button holes, and
seven extra <i>goblins</i> (as little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Edith called the 'goblets') stared
down at the plates, and seven
extra chairs were rattled up and
scratched up to the table, by
the children themselves, because
the waiting-maid was almost
crazy with so much company;
and down they sat in a prodigious
hurry, and the dinner began.</p>

<p>"Such a famous dinner as it
was! Perfectly delicious. If
there had only been a little more
of it. But never mind, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
knives and forks rattled merrily,
and the children laughed, and
the two long braids of hair on
each head flew right and left so
fast, that the flies couldn't get
near the table to taste of a
thing, and were almost distracted
when they saw every
single crumb eaten up, and
the plates nearly scraped into
holes.</p>

<p>"Here is the portrait of the
cook as she looked when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
waiter brought the beef-steak
dish.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i006.jpg" width="250" height="206" alt="Beef-steak dish" title="" />
</div>

<p>"But when the poor man's
pudding came in, smoking like
a Turk, and speckled in every
direction with great black raisins,
oh! then was the time for bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
looks! and when one little girl
clapped her hands, and exclaimed,
'My! that looks good!' all
the rest laughed, and whisked
their heads round so, that it was
quite fortunate their braids were
fast at one end, or they would
have been shaken off up the
chimney, and out of the door,
and nobody knows where else.</p>

<p>"The best thing was, that
there was plenty of pudding,
and the children thought it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the very nicest they had ever
eaten, particularly as the maid
brought to each one the bowl
of powdered sugar&mdash;so that they
might <i>help themselves</i> to as
much as they liked&mdash;<i>that</i> made
a great difference, I can tell you!
and they showered down the
sugar in grand style&mdash;they put
it on good and thick, just as
much sugar as pudding, and
that was what made it so very
nice; besides, Edith had whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to her mamma to give
the company '<i>all the raisinest
parts!!</i> because that was the
way to be polite to company,'
and so her mother did&mdash;and
they had a grand time picking
out the raisins to eat by themselves&mdash;and
the little spoons
went so fast, chopping at the
pudding, and clicking on the
plates, that Edith's mother said
it sounded like little stone-cutters
at work&mdash;at which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
grew perfectly red in their faces
laughing at themselves.</p>

<p>"Didn't they have a fine
time? I think so&mdash;and I
laughed very much&mdash;oh!&mdash;I
mean, Edith's papa laughed,
when he came home and heard
about the grand dinner-party,
all out of one small beef-steak,
and a poor man's pudding.
There! how do you like that
story?"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa! <i>I</i> know," exclaimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
Bella, laughing, and
patting his cheek. "I found
you out! it was sister Edith!
wasn't it? Dear me! what a
funny girl! Did you ever!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was her, and she was
a funny girl&mdash;and you are a
little darling&mdash;and now, kiss
papa, and run off to bed."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<h2>FIFTH LETTER.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A letter</span> for Miss Bella
Curtis; two cents!" bawled
the postman.</p>

<p>He was in a hurry this time,
and Bella had to run so fast for
the money, that it was quite a
wonder that she did not get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
thin after it&mdash;only she laughed,
too, just as much&mdash;and perhaps
that may be the reason.</p>

<p>She began to feel as if she
was quite a big woman, to be
giving the postman so much
business to do; and she carried
her new letter in great state to
her sister, and listened to the
reading of it with all her heart
and both her ears.</p>

<p>It began thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>&mdash;</p>


<div class='right'><br />
<small>"<span class="smcap">Savannah.</span></small><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Dear, Darling Bella</span>:</div>

<p>"I was perfectly delighted
with your funny little letter,
telling me all the news about
your party, and dolly, and
Kitty.</p>

<p>"I am now in Savannah.
It is a most beautiful city, and
the people in it are very good
and kind. The evening before
I left Charleston, a lady came
to see me, bringing with her a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
dear little boy who looked and
acted just like Stanny. I told
him the story of 'Little Red
Ridinghood,' and I thought his
eyes would pop out of his
head when the wolf eat her
up. You see, I growled and
snapped my teeth, just like a
wolf.</p>

<p>"Then I drew him a picture
of the wolf in a bob-tailed coat,
talking to Little Red Ridinghood
in the wood; and I made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
him a paper fly-cage, and a
paper windmill.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" width="389" height="368" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"He looked at them very
much pleased, and said: 'But&mdash;say&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
don't know which to
give to my little brother.'</p>

<p>"I laughed, for I saw that he
wanted them all himself, and
yet loved his little brother so
much that he wanted to give
them to him, so I said: 'If you
will kiss me and call me "Aunt
Fanny," I will make some for
him, too.'</p>

<p>"Then he put his arms round
my neck, and kissed me so hard,
that it made his dear little nose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
quite flat for a moment, and
said: 'Thank you, Mrs. Aunt
Fanny;' and I made him
another picture, and cage, and
windmill, and then he was delighted.</p>

<p>"There are two beautiful little
children in this house, who
are twins, because they came
into this world at the very same
time. They are each six years
old&mdash;a boy and a girl.</p>

<p>"I asked Richard where he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
came from? He said: 'Why,
don't you know? Sally and I
were dug up from under a cotton
tree.' Wasn't that funny?</p>

<p>"Then his mamma said:
'Richard, sing "Morning's ruddy
beams, in the Eastern sky,"'
and he shouted out&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Morning's <i>ready</i> beams<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Eascum eascum skri,'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>then stopped, and giving one
eye a queer little twist, said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
'How does <i>that</i> suit you?'
In the afternoon the children
went to a party, and Richard
brought home an orange for his
mother, and said: 'I'm going
to save this for your Christmas
present,' which sounded very
funny as Christmas was eight
months off.</div>

<p>"The next morning we had
flannel cakes for breakfast.
Really, and truly, they are
made of eggs, milk, and flour;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
but just for fun I pretended to
be astonished, and exclaimed:
'Flannel Cakes! Dear me! who
ever heard of such a thing?
Why, Richard, what <i>are</i> they
made of? Flannel?'</p>

<p>"'Why, no, you goose,' said
Richard, 'they are made of
<i>flannel flour</i>.'</p>

<p>"I could not help laughing
when he called me a goose;
but his mother said he was
very naughty; and then he ran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and hid his head in her dress
and began to cry. You see, he
was a little bit of a boy&mdash;and
did not mean to be impolite&mdash;and
I think myself, I would
have been a goose, if I <i>had</i>
really and truly believed the
cakes were made of flannel;
don't you, you little darling?</p>

<p>"I have a very curious
snake-skin to show you when
I return. Edward, Richard's
big brother, found it in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
woods, and made it a present
to me. A snake! What a
present! and to think of a
snake wanting to wriggle out
of his skin! You wouldn't do
such a thing, would you?</p>

<p>"Yesterday a beautiful little
mulatto girl came to see me,
and brought me, from her mistress,
a basket full of splendid
flowers. She was about five
years old. A great black man
with his head covered with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
white wool came with her to
take care of her, because she
was so little. He looked as if
he had been out in a snowstorm
without his hat; but
really his head was white because
he was so old. His
name was Jeringo. 'Well,
little one,' said I, 'what is your
name?'</p>

<p>"'My name Georgia, and I
can tell you a story. It is
about Blue Man's Beard.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Oh,' said I, 'I would like
to hear that very much indeed.'</p>

<p>"Then she put one little fat
hand over the other, drew a
long breath, and began: 'Blue
Man's Beard, he dreffel cross, I
tell you; and he say to he
<i>sister</i>, "Now, don't you go in
de rooms; you hear?" and she
say, "No, neber;" but she tell
story, and go; and oh, my!
she drop de key, and de key
he cum all over wid blood, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
she try, try, try, to wipe um off.
But he no cum off&mdash;and Blue
Man's Beard, he say: "If you
don't cum down I gib you
popping." Den her brother he
cum and tote her off to he
home, and make a big fire, and
burn Blue Man's Beard all up
in de fire.'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' said I, 'how glad I
am! Aren't you glad?'</p>

<p>"'Ah, no,' she replied, 'I
don't want any body to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
burn up&mdash;make 'em hurt:'
which answer made me feel
quite ashamed, because I was
more cruel than she; then I
gave Georgia some money, and
sent her home quite happy.
What do you think of that
story? Don't the little mulatto
girl talk queerly? All the
black people talk so.</p>

<p>"The other night I felt quite
ill, and the dear friend with
whom I am staying sent Hannah,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
a black girl, up to me
with a tub of warm water to
bathe my feet. She dropped a
little bobbing courtesy, and said:
'Please missis, you ain't berry
well, I'se want to wash you
foot.'</p>

<p>"'Oh dear, no, Hannah, I
cannot let you bathe my feet;
I always do that for myself.'</p>

<p>"'Oh <i>do</i>, please missis; I
ain't got noting to do. I <i>like</i>
to wash um.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>"'But, Hannah, I shall feel
very funny to have you poking
at my toes.'</p>

<p>"'Now missis, <i>do</i>,' said Hannah,
in a coaxing tone; 'I'll
do um fust rate.'</p>

<p>"Her eyes looked so big, and
she made such a queer face at
me, that I turned round to
laugh; when I looked back
she was standing at the long
glass making courtesies to herself;
then she turned round,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and twisted her head till I
thought she would crack it
off&mdash;and stared at her back
and made some more courtesies&mdash;and
I had to laugh out loud,
and she looked quite ashamed.</p>

<p>"Then I said: 'Hannah, do
you really want to bathe my
feet?'</p>

<p>"''Strue as you live, missis.'</p>

<p>"'Would you like me to
read to you?'</p>

<p>"'Oh do, missis! tank you.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Well, then, you may, and
I will read Little Susy's Six
Birthdays to you.'</p>

<p>"That seemed to be a most
delightful idea&mdash;and she pulled
off my boots and stockings in a
great hurry, and lifted my feet
into the water, and passed her
hands so gently over my ankles
that it really seemed to do me
good; but when she poked between
my toes, she tickled me
so dreadfully that I squealed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
and laughed, and came very
near upsetting the tub of water.</p>

<p>"But she liked the book very
much, and her great black eyes
were full of love and gratitude
as she thanked me; and I
thanked her, and gave her a
penny; but she liked my <i>thanking
her</i> better than the penny.</p>

<p>"I have bought you a pretty
little green parasol; and I love
you, oh! so dearly! you precious
little roly-poly tweedle-de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
diamond-darling! What do
you think of that for a love
name? you sweet little humpy-dumpy
tweedle-dum rosebud
robin! there's another; from
your loving</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Mother.</span>"<br />
</div>

<p>How Bella laughed at the
love-names, and how happy
they made her, is more than I
can describe; but she cuddled
up to Edith, and whispered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear <i>little</i> mamma," and that
was all she said.</p>

<p>The next day was Sunday.
Bella was old enough to go to
church, and she behaved very
well.</p>

<p>Just before they went in, her
father said: "Bella, there will
be a collection taken up to-day,
and here is a nice new penny
for you to put in the plate."</p>

<p>"What plate, papa?"</p>

<p>"Why, the plate for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
money that is given to the poor.
You will see six of them on
the table just under the pulpit."</p>

<p>Bella had never put any
money in the plate before, and
she was quite pleased.</p>

<p>When they were seated in
their pew in the middle aisle, a
little bit of a boy wanted to
come in, because his papa's pew
was quite crowded. His name
was Eddie; and he knew Bella
very well. So in he came, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the two children sat next the
door.</p>

<p>Presently, Bella whispered:
"Look, Eddie, look at my new
penny. I am going to put it
in the plate for the poor
peoples."</p>

<p>"Why, I've got a penny, too,
most as bright as yours; but
where is the plate?"</p>

<p>They looked all over the
church, and at last spied the
plates on the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"When will we put it in?"
said Bella.</p>

<p>"Why, now; let's go now,"
said Eddie.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Bella.</p>

<p>Then, before her father could
stop her, she opened the pew
door, and stepped out with
Eddie, and hand in hand the
two little children marched
gravely up the aisle, to the
table under the pulpit; and
standing on tiptoe, put their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bright pennies into the plate;
and then hand in hand gravely
marched back.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>They did not know that they
were doing what would make
everybody look at them in astonishment.
No, indeed! they
were in a hurry to help the
poor people; and I think everybody
in the church understood
it, and looked with loving eyes
upon the little ones.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>
<p>The next day Bella told her
papa what to say, and he wrote
her mother this letter:</p>


<div class='unindent'><br />"<span class="smcap">Dear, Darling Mamma</span>:</div>

<p>"Yesterday I gave the poor
peoples a penny in church. So
did Eddie. We went together
and put it in the plate. Aren't
you glad, the poor peoples have
so much money? I am.</p>

<p>"Sister Edith showed me
such a 'lightful play. She did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
put me on the end of the sofa,
and I go backward and forward,
backward and forward,
and she sings:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Grandmamma's sick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">And is going to die,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And nothing will cure her</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">But a <span class="smcap">turn</span>-over pie;'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and then I go tumbledy over
backward on the sofa so nice!
Don't you wish you could play
it?</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Georgia told the story the
wrong way; it was Blue Beard's
<i>wife</i>, not his sister. Of course
it was! She is a funny girl.
I wish she would come and
play with me.</p>

<p>"O dear, darling mamma!
when will you come? I want
you so bad. I hope you are
most well this day. Can you
bring me a kitten? Please do;
and put it in a piece of paper,
and tie it up tight, so it won't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
get out. Miss Hattie's head is
most torn off; but I don't care,
'cause she's only made of paper,
and she is so ugly. I have
painted her all over with red
spots&mdash;and now she looks just
like a leopard&mdash;I call her a <i>pig</i>-leopard&mdash;don't
tell anybody.</p>

<p>"How funny for Hannah to
tickle your toes! My toes make
me squeal, too, when they
are washed; and&mdash;and&mdash;I don't
know any more, papa."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>So this letter was finished&mdash;and
Bella's mother thought this
and the others were lovely letters&mdash;and
I should not be surprised
if she keeps them as long
as she lives.</p>

<h2>SIXTH LETTER.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">A letter</span> for Miss Bella
Curtis," shouted the postman;
"four cents." It was quite a
thick letter this time, and Bella
had to pay twice two cents for
it. How much was that? If
you will give me a kiss I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
tell you&mdash;two and two make
four.</p>

<p>But, dear me! she was just
as glad to get it&mdash;and I do believe
if she had had four dollars
she would have given every
speck of it for one letter.
Why, certainly! A letter from
your <span class="smcap">mother</span>?&mdash;<i>you</i> would do
so, too. Of course you would,
you sweet little Ba-be-bi-bo-BOO!!!</p>

<p>So it was taken to Edith, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
if you had been an hundred
years old, you would have felt
quite young again&mdash;only to have
watched Bella's eyes while the
letter was read&mdash;diamonds don't
sparkle half as much, and I for
one would rather have had her
bright eyes to look at, than a
whole bushel of diamonds, each
as big as my head.</p>

<p>The delightful letter commenced
thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>


<div class='right'><br />
<small>"<span class="smcap">Charleston.</span></small><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Dear, Darling Bella</span>:</div>

<p>"I have your sweet little
letter, and I am so much
obliged to you for telling papa
such nice things to write to me,
that I have sent you a long,
long answer in return, which I
hope will please you.</p>

<p>"I left Savannah yesterday.
When I was leaving, I kissed
little Richard, and said: 'Good-bye,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Richard; don't forget Aunt
Fanny.'</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">

<span class="caption">GOOD-BYE, RICHARD, DON&#39;T FORGET AUNT FANNY.</span>
</div>

<p>"'I forgot you already,' he
shouted. Then I kissed Sallie,
the twin-girl, and she said so
sweetly: 'Aunt Fanny, can you
remember where Bella lives?
If you can find her house, go
and tell her I am coming to see
her&mdash;next day before to-morrow.'</p>

<p>"Wasn't it funny that she
should think I had been so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
long away from you, my little
darling, that I had forgotten
where you lived?</p>

<p>"Do you remember a story I
once read to you, about 'Good
Little Henry,' in a book called
'Nightcaps'? Well, strange
to say, I know this Henry, and
love him very much. He is
now almost a young man, and
just as good as ever; yes! better
than ever, for he is the comfort
and joy of his father and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
mother. Only think, dear Bella!
that from a good and lovely
little child he has grown better
and lovelier every year, till now
he is almost a man. God loves
Henry; and He has helped him
to be good, and He will love
you and help you to be good,
if you will ask Him.</p>

<p>"I tell you all this now,
because in looking over my
writing-desk a moment ago, I
came upon an amusing story<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Henry wrote to me, about some
little cousins of his."</p>

<p>Of course you would like to
know what he wrote, and here
it is:</p>

<p>"One day my dear Aunt
Sarah was sitting up-stairs
with the children, when the
front door bell rang, and the
servant came up and said:
'Mr. Robinson wants to see
you, ma'am.' So aunt put on
her best collar, and a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
lace cap, and down she
went.</p>

<p>"'My!' said Loulou, 'I
should like to see him, too.'</p>

<p>"'So should I,' said Bolton,
whose pet name is 'Pepper.'</p>

<p>"'Dear me! I, too,' cried
Anna, whose pet name is 'Tot.'</p>

<p>"'And me! me! me!' said
little Walter, jumping up and
down.</p>

<p>"So Loulou, in a great state
of delight, rushed up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
washstand and washed her face
and hands; then she took Pepper
and scrubbed him well&mdash;rubbing
his nose almost off
to get his face dry&mdash;and dressed
him in all his best Sunday
clothes, and told him to sit
down in his little chair, perfectly
stiff and straight, till the
rest were ready; and down
little Pepper sat, and hardly
dared to wink, for fear of
getting his clothes tumbled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then she took little Tot,
and polished her face, and
brushed her hair as hard as
she could, and Tot never cried
the least bit, when Loulou accidentally
turned the brush round
and gave her a thump with the
back of it; but just sat down
by Pepper when her dressing
was over, and kept as still and
looked as grave as if she were
in church.</p>

<p>"And now Loulou took dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
little Walter in hands, and made
him as fine as you please; and
then they all marched down
stairs on tip-toe, trembling with
expectation.</p>

<p>"They opened the parlor
door and entered very softly,
and stared with all their eyes.
But where was he?</p>

<p>"There was nobody there
but their mamma, and a very
quiet-looking gentleman in a
plain black coat, and a pair of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
spectacles, set on the very end
of his nose, who appeared to be
showing her some curious coins.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/i009.jpg" width="550" height="351" alt="ROBINSON CRUSOE." title="" />
<span class="caption">ROBINSON CRUSOE.</span>
</div>

<p>"The children stood perfectly
still for a moment. They
seemed to be struck dumb.
Then Loulou exclaimed:</p>

<p>"'Why, <i>mamma</i>, we have
come down on purpose to see
<span class="smcap">Robinson Crusoe</span>!! all dressed
in fur, with his monkeys and
parrots, and Man Friday.
Where <i>is</i> he, mamma? where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
<i>has</i> he gone?' and they looked
again in every corner of the
room.</p>

<p>"How her mamma did laugh!
and how Mr. Robinson did
laugh! when they found that
the children thought that
Robinson Crusoe had come to
see them; but Loulou and the
rest of the dear little children
were dreadfully disappointed.
Wasn't that a pity?</p>

<p>"And now I have a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
secret to tell you; I am so
much better, and I want to see
you s&mdash;o much, that I mean to
return home in the steamship
which leaves on Saturday.
This is Thursday&mdash;you will get
this long letter next Monday&mdash;and
on Tuesday have ready at
least a hundred kisses, and fifty
squeezes for your loving</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Mamma.</span>"<br />
</div>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE RETURN.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">"Oh!"</span> screamed Bella, joyfully,
"mamma coming home?
Oh! oh! oh!" and she commenced
to dance about the
room, and laugh, and sing so
many little songs, that Edith
thought there must be a musical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
snuff-box inside of her;
particularly as she stopped to
give two funny little sneezes,
and then went on again. She
could hardly sit still a moment
all the rest of the day; and she
begged to be put to bed earlier
than usual, so that the "next
day might come faster."</p>

<p>Sure enough! the next day
a carriage drove up to the door.
It was raining, and Bella had
to stay in the room for fear she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
would take cold. She fastened
her face to the window, and
trembling with eagerness, saw
the coachman open the door.
A <i>gentleman</i> got out&mdash;Bella's
face looked as if somebody had
thrown a pail of cold water in
it&mdash;but, the next moment, the
gentleman handed out her
mamma, her very own mamma!
and then in an ecstasy of delight,
the little girl rushed to
the door, and then it was worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
more than all Barnum's Museum
to see the meeting. I believe I
can't tell it&mdash;I cannot write it
well enough; but all you dear
little children know how glad
you are to see your kind mothers
after they have been away
from you; and you can <i>feel</i>
this, much better than I can
write it.</p>

<p>And so ended the Little
Nightcap Letters; and though
Bella cherished them as her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
dearest treasures, and means to
keep them, she says, to show
to her children; yet, she would
rather have her own "real,
true" mamma to kiss, and love,
and keep close to; and she
never means to part with her
again, if she can help it.</p>

<p>That is just the way you feel,
isn't it, you little darling?</p>
